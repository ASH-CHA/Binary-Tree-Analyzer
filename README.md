# Binary-Tree-Analyzer
The Binary Tree Analyzer is a Java console application that constructs and analyzes binary trees based on user input. The program reads a binary tree described in preorder notation, validates its syntax, prints the tree in an indented format, and determines whether the tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST) and whether it is balanced.
